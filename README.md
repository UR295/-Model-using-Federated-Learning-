# Federated Learning
# ü§ñ Federated Learning in AI

Federated Learning (FL) is a **distributed machine learning (ML)** technique that enables training across multiple devices or servers without exchanging raw data. Instead, it shares only model updates, thus preserving **data privacy** and **security** ‚Äî a crucial factor in modern AI applications.

### üòü Do You Find It Difficult To Understand ?

Lets explain in a simple terms , 
Federated Learning simply reverses the classical machine learning approach. It enables machine learning on distributed data by moving the training to the data, instead of moving the data to the training. Here‚Äôs a one-liner explanation:
* **Centralized machine learning:** move the data to the computation
* **Federated (machine) Learning:** move the computation to the data

> ‚ú® _Want to know where Federated Learning fits into AI?_  
> It lies at the intersection of **AI**, **privacy**, and **edge computing**, revolutionizing how models are trained without centralized data collection.

## üîÑ How It Works

1. **Initialization:** A global model is initialized on a central server.

2. **Local Training:** Devices (e.g., smartphones, hospitals, IoT sensors) train the model locally on their private data.

3. **Model Update:** The updated model parameters (not data) are sent back to the server.

4. **Aggregation:**  The server aggregates these updates using techniques like FedAvg (Federated Averaging).

5. **Repeat:** The updated global model is sent back to clients for the next round.

## üß† Types of Federated Learning

- **Centralized Federated Learning**  
  - A central server coordinates training and aggregation.
  
- **Decentralized Federated Learning**  
  - No central server; clients communicate peer-to-peer.

- **Horizontal Federated Learning**  
  - Clients share the same feature space but different data samples.

- **Vertical Federated Learning**  
  - Clients have different features for the same user or entity.

- **Cross-silo Federated Learning**  
  - Fewer, more powerful clients (e.g., hospitals, banks).

- **Cross-device Federated Learning**  
  - Massive number of edge devices (e.g., smartphones, IoT).

## üèóÔ∏è FL Architecture Types Explain 
1. Centralized Federated Learning
A central server orchestrates communication.
Most common and easy to implement.

2. Decentralized Federated Learning
No central server; peer-to-peer communication.
Complex but reduces single-point-of-failure risks.

3. Horizontal FL
Clients have the same features but different users (e.g., banks in different cities).

4. Vertical FL
Clients share users but different features (e.g., bank and e-commerce site).

5. Cross-Silo FL
Fewer, powerful clients (e.g., hospitals, corporations).

6. Cross-Device FL
Millions of edge devices like phones or wearables participate in training.

## üìâ Challenges in Federated Learning

* Non-IID Data: Data distributions vary between clients.

* System Heterogeneity: Devices differ in computation, power, network.

* Communication Bottleneck: Frequent model updates can overload networks.

* Client Dropout: Devices may disconnect or fail to respond.
